# Trial of the Champion

## Story

Whenever you want to get a job you have to go through the process of interviewing regardless of the position you applied (this is the most common scenario). This is the main reason we provide mock interview occasions in Codecool. Actually, you can take this as your final proof that you finished Codecool, and you are ready to apply real life positions. Based on our experience if you start the preparation only after the advanced module it is simply not enough time to acquire the necessary experience and practice with mock interviews. In order to bring the preparation phase earlier we provide this project interlude focusing on.

In this project your task is to go through the preparation steps of your mock interviews.
