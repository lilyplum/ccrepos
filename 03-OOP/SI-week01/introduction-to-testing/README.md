# Introduction to Testing

This is a guided project
To learn the most, try and implement it on your own first, and check the solution only when you feel necessary. However,
if you feel completely stuck, feel free to check the [step-by-step solution guide]()

JUnit is an open-source framework designed for writing and running tests in the Java programming language. JUnit,
originally written by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck, has been important in the evolution of test-driven development. In this
project, you learn the beauty of JUnit.

What are you going to learn?

* Use JUnit.
* Undersand testing.
* Use Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) syntax.

## Tasks

### Create a Maven project

Create a new project using the newest version of Maven and add the JUnit into the dependencies.

* A new Maven project is created using IntelliJ.
* The newest version of JUnit is added to the pom.xml and installed.

### Create a class

Create a new class named HelloWorld. Inside the class, create a new function named getMessage(), which returns the
message "Hello World".

* The HelloWorld class is created.
* The getMessage() function returns "Hello World".

### The first test

Create your first test to test the getMessage() function of the HelloWorld class.

* The HelloWorldTest is created.
* The getMessageTest() unit test method is created.
* The functionality of getMessage() is tested using the _AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) syntax.

### OPTIONAL TASK: Calculator

Create a new class named Calculator with a function that adds two numbers.

* The Calculator class is created. It has a working sum() function.
* The sum() function of the Calculator class is tested using a unit test.

### Hints

* This project does not contain a starter repository.
* Give your tests descriptive names so you can understand them better later.
