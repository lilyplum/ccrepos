# bonus-in-the-air

Life is hard for poor brokers: they got low (okay, relatively low) fixed salaries, and the bigger part of their income
come from bonus payments. And bonus comes after the profit they made that month. This incentive makes them fight for
success fiercely. "Man is wolf to man", as they say, and it's even more true on Wall street.

The bank you are working for has a software to calculate company-level profit, and implicitly broker salaries as well.
This piece of code works, but it is a complete mess, and the guys who created it are long gone. The management would
like to change the bonus system a bit but no one dares to touch the legacy code.

Here you come to save the day and clean up this mess. As a well-trained programmer, you plan to cover the existing
profit calculator with unit tests. After that you can start refactoring the code until you reverse engineered the whole
thing.

If you succeed, you can expect a fat bonus check :)

What are you going to learn?

* Understand legacy code.
* Write unit tests.
* Refactor code guarded by unit tests.

## Tasks

### Add JUnit dependency

Add JUnit 5 as a Maven dependency to your pom.xml. Include that specific JUnit 5 version you were advised to use in the
JUnit tutorial.

* JUnit dependency is added to pom.xml, using the version suggested in the previous JUnit tutorial

### Write tests for the legacy company profit calculator

Cover the code with unit tests, try to cover edge cases. The more you understand from the code, the better you can do
this. Some examples:

* Create a test for the case when no brokers has achieved any profit.
* Create a test for the case when brokers have achieved some profit but none has reached the minimum bonus limit.
* Create a test for the case when at least some brokers have reached the minimum bonus limit.

---

* There is a test file with at least three test cases for CompanyProfitCalculator's calculate() method.
* The test cases and arguments try to cover significantly different scenarios for the profit calculation logic.

### Refactor the calculator

After securing the code with unit tests, you can start refactoring it. First, "save" the legacy version and its test
class into a different subpackage (legacy will do), so that you can run it and compare the outcomes with the refactored
version. Then do what you have to do: rename, rephrase, extract parts of the original code until you feel it clean
enough to go into production. You can create new fields, methods, classes, as you see fit.

* The refactored version has meaningful and fit names for new classes, methods, fields, and local variables. There are
  no remnants of cryptic, abbreviated names from the original version.
* The refactored version has methods with single responsibilities.
* The refactored version passes the same test assertions as the original one.
* The original CompanyProfitCalculator is reachable in a legacy subpackage, along with the tests you'd created for it

### Add more tests

Now that you have a clean and easily understandable profit calculator, extend your test suite to cover the newly created
parts of the code. For example, if you have extracted a class from the CompanyProfitCalculator class based on the SRP,
then you should provide a unit test class for it as well, and cover it fully.

* Every newly created public service methods are covered with tests.

### Hints

* Remember that test classes (like CompanyProfitCalculatorTest) should be placed not in the src/main, but in the
  src/test directory, under the same package name as the original class.
