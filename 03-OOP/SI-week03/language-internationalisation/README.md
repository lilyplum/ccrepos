# language-internationalisation

Some say, that English is way easier than other languages. For sure, native English-speakers have a huge advantage when
it comes to communication, as it has
the [highest number of total speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers)
around the globe.

Though, the English-speaking world of ours can face huge issues, when it comes to the special characters present in
other languages.

German language, for example, is classified
by [Category II](https://www.fsi-language-courses.org/blog/fsi-language-difficulty/) difficulty. This means, that a
native English speaker needs to spend an average of 30 weeks to learn German based on the FSI language course provider
institution.

This can cause troubles, when we deal with different types
of [character encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding).

Your task is to "internationalise" German text, by switching their special characters to internationally accepted
letter-combinations.

What are you going to learn?

* Reading file
* Writing file
* Java String manipulation

## Tasks

### Read

Read the text from german-example.txt.

* The lines of the german-example.txt are logged out to the console.

### Edit

Replace the umlauts with the same vowel with “e” afterward and ß into double s.

```
ö -> oe
ü -> ue
ä -> ae
ß -> ss
```

* The ö, ü, ä, ß characters are replaced with oe, ue, ae, ss.

### Write

Save the internationalized text into the internationalized.txt.

* There is a new file named internationalized.txt containing the internationalized text.
