On the first day of the summer-break you sat together with your classmates to plan the whole holiday season. On the
meeting you decided to minimize your spending and practice programming at the same time.

Your responsibility is to optimize printing costs of the summer reading assignments. For this you need to write a
program that cuts up the books into separate files so you can share printing costs and read the book in parallel.

What are you going to learn?

* Read from files
* Write to files
* String processing

## Tasks

### Read The republic chapter names

Read the list of chapter names from the-republic.txt. E.g. the first chapter's name is INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS.

* List of chapter names from the-republic.txt is read to an appropriate Java collection

### Read The republic chapter contents

Read the list of chapter contents from the-republic.txt.

* List of chapter contents from the-republic.txt is read to an appropriate Java collection

### Write The republic's chapters

Write The republic's chapter contents out into separate files

* For each chapter from the the-republic.txt exists a file with the following rules:
    * <CHAPTER-NAME>: the name of the chapter
    * Filename: the-republic - <CHAPTER-NAME>.txt
    * File contents: all contents in the chapter from the the-republic.txt

### Test your code

Test your code with unit tests. It is advised to create a short file for the unit test with the same structure as the
the-republic.txt file's and use it in your test.

* Reading chapter names from a file is tested.
* Reading chapter contents from a file is tested.
* Creating files with proper names is tested.
* Writing chapter contents to a file is tested.

### Write Alice in wonderland's chapters

Write Alice in wonderland's chapter contents out into separate files. You can find this book in the
alice-in-wonderland.txt file.

* For each chapter from the alice-in-wonderland.txt exists a file with the following rules:
    * <CHAPTER-NAME>: the name of the chapter
    * Filename: alice-in-wonderland - <CHAPTER-NAME>.txt
    * File contents: all contents in the chapter from the alice-in-wonderland.txt

### Organize your code to eliminate code duplications.

Organize your code to eliminate code duplication's and hard-coded strings.

* There are no if statements in the code that check the book's name and there is no or just minimal code-duplication.
* Test your code with unit tests. It is advised to create short files for the unit tests with the same structure as the
  the-republic.txt and alice-in-wonderland.txt file's and use them in your test.
