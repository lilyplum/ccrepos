# Sorting flowchart

Your friend Maria found an old and dusty notebook with flowcharts on its almost completely faded pages. She asked you to
help her write the JavaScript code equivalent of the flowcharts.

The first flowchart looks like a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the array, compares each pair of
adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The second flowchart seems to divide the array into smaller arrays to find the searched value.
The third flowchart looks for prime numbers.

What are you going to learn?

* Write code based on a flowchart.
* Sort numbers without built-in methods.
* Use for and while loops.
* Use algorithms.

## Tasks

### Bubble Sort algorithm

Implement the algorithm described by this flowchart.

* Running the function with the array [1, 2, 56, 32, 51, 2, 8, 92, 15] sorts it in ascending
  order ([1, 2, 2, 8, 15, 32, 51, 56, 92]). The result is not hardcoded. The steps seen in the flowchart are used.

### Binary Search algorithm

Implement the algorithm described by this flowchart.

* Calling the function with the array [1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 22, 38, 42, 43] and the number 42 returns 7. Calling the function
  with the same array and the number 15 returns -1.

### OPTIONAL TASK: Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm

Implement the algorithm described by this flowchart.

* Running the program returns an array of all prime numbers, that are lesser or equal to the parameter N.

### Hints

* Bubble sort: There are two loops and both of them can be implemented with while or for. Think about which one is more
  suited to what situation.
* Bubble sort: One loop is an outer loop and one is an inner loop. Do you know which one is which?
* In the Binary Search task, the variables need to be integers!
