# Let's test
Once upon a time there was an wise old Mentor, who had many students. He taught them how to write code. The wise old Mentor prepares exercises, challenges and projects for them to do, and then later he took the students' code and checked whether it is done properly. As time went on, the Mentor got wiser (and older) and the number of his students grew even more. Eventually, checking his students' code took hours from the wise old Mentor's precious time, so he thought: "Why am I checking these exercises manually? I'm a programmer, after all. I automatize things!".

And then, the wise old Mentor wrote a piece of code that was designed to check other pieces of code automatically. And thus, unit tests were born.

What are you going to learn?
* Run unit tests to check the correctness of the results of your code.
* Use the Jest testing library.
## Tasks

### Complete the project and pass the tests
Implement given functions, then run the unit tests to assure that the functions are Implemented properly.

* All three unit tests pass (they appear green).
* The names and parameters of the functions (their names and order) are not changed.
* The functions operate on logic and do not return hardcoded values, so that they just pass the tests.


### General requirements

### Hints
* Testing your code is really important, this project showcases how tests work in general.
* You don't have to install any test (or other) npm package to run these tests.
* You can run the tests with the node functions.test.js command in the terminal.
* You can also run the test with the npx jest functions.test.js command in the terminal. If you want to run only one test (out of all the tests you have in your file) you can do that with for example, the npx jest functions.test.js -t "addTwoNumbers" command if you want to run the test named "addTwoNumbers".
* Write only the inside of the functions in the functions.js file.
