# frontend-vs-backend
Most of the projects have a frontend and a backend side. Typically, the code runs in a browser called frontend and the code runs independently on a computer (launched from a terminal). The best thing in JavaScript is that you can run it on both the frontend and backend side. :) This project will show you an insight into what you can do with javascript in the browser and in the terminal. Don't worry if you don't understand the whole client-server (frontend-backend) architecture, you don't have to create a real (web) server.

What are you going to learn?
* getting familiar with JavaScript in the Browser
* getting familiar with JavaScript on the Server side
## Tasks

### Server side (Backend)
Lets start with the server side. Log the word Server in different ways to the terminal.

* Running the server.js file from the terminal displays the word Server.
* Running the server.js file from the terminal displays the word Server in reverse order.
* Running the server.js file from the terminal displays the number of letters in the word Server.
* Running the server.js file from the terminal displays the number of letters in the word Server multiplied by 3.
* Running the server.js file from the terminal displays the number of letters in the word Server divided by 5.1

### Client side (Frontend)
Continue with the client side. Log the word Client in different ways in the Browser's Console.

* When you open the index.html in a web browser and open the developer tools console tab the word Client is displayed.
* When you open the index.html in a web browser and open the developer tools console tab the word Client in reversed order is displayed.
* When you open the index.html in a web browser and open the developer tools console tab the number of letters in the word Client is displayed.
* When you open the index.html in a web browser and open the developer tools console tab the number of letters in the word Client multiplied by 3 is displayed.
* When you open the index.html in a web browser and open the developer tools console tab the number of letters in the word Client divided by 5 is displayed.2


### Hints
* You can run the code on server side with VS Code's terminal using the node ./backend/server.js
* You can write your frontend code into the frontend/script.js file then open the index.html with your preferred browser (Chrome Dev Edition or Firefox Developer Edition is recommended)
* when reversing the word use the built-in string manipulation functions instead of writing by hand the letters
