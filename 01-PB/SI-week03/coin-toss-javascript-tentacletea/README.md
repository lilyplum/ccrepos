# Coin Toss

This is a guided project
To learn the most, try and implement it on your own first, and check the solution only when you feel necessary. However,
if you feel completely stuck, feel free to check the [step-by-step solution guide](SolutionGuide.md)
You argue with your colleague at work on who would get the parking space. Since both of you have the right to it you
decided that a simple coint toss would be the best way to find out takes the spot. Being programmers, it's just to easy
to use a normal coin flip so you have decided to write an app that does that for you :)

What are you going to learn?

* change classes of HTML elements via JS
* change text of HTML elements via JS

## Tasks

### Change the text to state what coin side has been randomly chosen

The page should display what coin side was chosen

The paragraph with the id message should randomly display the text You have chosen tails or You have chosen heads each
time the index.html page is loaded

### Display either the `heads` or `tails` image

The page should display either the heads or tails image each time the index.html page is loaded

When opening the index.html in a browser there should be only 1 image displayed. Refreshing the page in the browser
should randomly change what image is displayed

### Hints

* In order to show or hide the image you can create a css class that sets the property display: hidden and then via
javascript to add or remove it.
